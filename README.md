## 🏙️ What is UrbanGenVR?

UrbanGenVR is an  **Urban Design Generative Adversarial Network** packaged as a **Streamlit web application**.  
It combines **UNet semantic segmentation**, **Voronoi spatial planning**, and **WebGL-ready 3D city generation** to let architects, urban planners, and game designers turn any hand-drawn boundary sketch or satellite image into a fully navigable 3D city model—**no GIS or CAD tools required**.
